        <div class="text-2xl font-sans text-red-200 ml-20 mr-[600px] text-left pt-10">Initially spotify started off as a music library. But when they saw a lot of potential in users' data to generate recommendation to elevate the experience. Discover playlists proved beneficial for all of the users. It catered to the users who didn't have time to make playlists for different events, it catered to users to find new music, helped artists reach larger audiences and ultimately helped Spotify grow to what it is today.  <br/>
        The recommendation model was based on two approaches to analyzing data: first user modeling, i.e. analyzing the user's emotion and moods and other the situational parameters like time of day, day of the week and time of the year. User modeling leads to adding some attributes to the user and then recommending them songs with same set of attributes.
